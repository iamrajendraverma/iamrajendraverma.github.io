## ⚡ Smart Switch Types

We offer three distinct switch types, each tailored for specific automation needs.

### 1️⃣ Binary Switch

*The classic control, redefined.*

The **Binary Switch** provides instant, manual control over any connected device. It mimics a physical switch but adds digital reporting.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instant Toggle** | Tap to turn ON/OFF with zero latency. |
| **Usage Tracking** | Displays a real-time elapsed timer while the device is ON. |
| **Feedback** | Visual confirmation of the current state across all connected apps. |

**Best For:** Lights, fans, or any appliance where you need simple manual control and want to track usage.

### 2️⃣ Delay Switch (Timer-Based)

*Set it and forget it.*

The **Delay Switch** is perfect for devices that should only run for a fixed duration. It prevents energy waste and ensures safety.

* **How to use:** Tap "Start", set your desired duration (HH:MM:SS), and let the app handle the rest.
* **Automatic Shut-off:** The device turns OFF exactly when the countdown reaches zero.
* **Visual Countdown:** Stay informed with a live countdown timer on your dashboard.

**Best For:** Electric vehicle charging, bathroom exhaust fans, or water pumps.

### 3️⃣ Interval Switch (Scheduled)

*Ultimate Automation.*

The **Interval Switch** allows you to schedule operations in advance. It supports two powerful modes:

#### 🕒 Once Mode

Set a "Start After" delay and a "Duration". The device will wait for the specified delay, turn ON for the duration, and then turn OFF.
*Example: Start the washing machine in 30 minutes for a 1-hour cycle.*

#### 📅 Daily Mode

Schedule a specific time (e.g., 06:00 AM) and a duration. The task repeats every single day.
*Example: Water your garden every morning for 15 minutes.*

| Mode | Trigger | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Once** | Countdown Delay | One-time delayed tasks |
| **Daily** | Specific Clock Time | Recurring daily routines |
