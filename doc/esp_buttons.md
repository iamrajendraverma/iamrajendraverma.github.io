## Switch Types and Functionality

### 1. Binary Switch

The **Binary Switch** is the most fundamental control element. It acts just like a physical wall switch but with an added digital advantage.

- **How it works:** Simply tap the toggle to turn your device ON or OFF instantly.
- **Key Feature:** When the switch is ON, the app displays a real-time elapsed timer, showing exactly how long the device has been running.
- **Use Case:** Perfect for manual control of overhead lights, fans, or any appliance where you just need a simple ON/OFF button and want to keep track of usage duration.

### 2. Delay Switch

The **Delay Switch** is designed for tasks that require a device to run for a specific amount of time before automatically turning itself off.

- **How it works:** When you tap "Start", a timer dialog appears. You can set the exact duration (Hours, Minutes, Seconds) you want the device to remain active. Once the timer starts, the device turns ON and counts down.
- **Key Feature:** It ensures you never "forget" to turn off high-power appliances.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for charging an electric scooter for 3 hours, running a bathroom exhaust fan for 15 minutes, or operating a water pump that only needs to fill a specific tank volume.

### 3. Interval Switch

The **Interval Switch** offers the highest level of automation, allowing you to schedule when a device should turn on and for how long. It supports two modes: **Once** and **Daily**.

- **How it works:**
  - **Once Mode:** You set a "Start After" delay (e.g., in 60 seconds) and a "Duration" (how long it stays ON).
  - **Daily Mode:** You set a specific "Start At" time (e.g., 07:30 AM) and a "Duration".
- **Key Feature:** Advanced scheduling that manages both the "waiting" period and the "active" period automatically.
- **Use Case:**
  - **Once:** Setting a "delayed start" for a kitchen appliance so it finishes right when you arrive home.
  - **Daily:** Automating a garden irrigation system to turn on every morning at 6:00 AM for 20 minutes to keep your plants healthy without manual intervention.
