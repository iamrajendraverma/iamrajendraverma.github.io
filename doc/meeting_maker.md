## 🚀 Getting Started

The meeting maker app  is doing the recording of the meeting  and send it to the server for processing. The server is using the cloud transcription services to convert the audio to text and generate the summary of the meeting. **whisper-large-v3-groq** is used for transcription and in the next version we will use **LLM** to generate the summary of the meeting.
